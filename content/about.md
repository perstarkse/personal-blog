# About

## Why a blog

I want to improve my writing, and also try and validate my thoughts and ideas by communicating them to others.

## Me

I'm a psychologist, software developer and part time politician. I have a passion for technology and I enjoy new ideas & challenges. I strongly believe in open source, both ideas and code, and generally strive to contribute.

## Blog technicals

The blog is built using Nuxt and some modules, the most significant being [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) which allows me to write the posts, and most of the site if I want, using Markdown. The source code is availible at [Github](https://github.com/perstarkse/personal-blog) if you want to take a look. The style of the page is almost all due to [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

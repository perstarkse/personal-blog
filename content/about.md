# About

## Why a blog
Because I enjoy it. Much as my approach to most endeavors. My primary motivation for learning new things is because I enjoy finding out new approaches, truths and *stuff*. I am deeply fascinated and impressed by those with great writing skills, an area I'd like to see if I can improve. 

## Me
Labels and categorisations only capture some of the aspects of who we are. But of those typically presented in contexts such as these I'm a parent, psychologist, software developer and part time politician.

I'm a person with quite a lot of curiosity and drive and I've been privileged in many regards and I deeply believe in the sharing of ideas and knowledge, including source code.

## Blog technicals
The blog is built using Nuxt and some modules, the most significant being [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) which allows me to write the posts, and most of the site if I want, using Markdown. The source code is availible at [Github](https://github.com/perstarkse/personal-blog) if you want to take a look. The style of the page is almost all due to [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

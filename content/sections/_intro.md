# Learning out loud

\[A blog about growth and discovery - Per Stark\]{.subtitle .text-purple-400}

Welcome to my blog, a space where I share my journey of continuous learning and personal growth. This blog serves as a platform for me to "learn out loud" and document my experiences as I explore various topics.

I firmly believe in the power of open source and collaborative learning. I'm a strong advocate for the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, and I believe that we can all benefit from the collective wisdom of our communities. I hope to contribue to that by sharing my experiences.

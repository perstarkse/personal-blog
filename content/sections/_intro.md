# Learning out loud

[A blog about growth and discovery - Per Stark]{.subtitle .text-purple-400}

Welcome to my blog, a space where I share my journey of continuous learning and personal growth. As a psychologist and software developer, I've always been fascinated by the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge. This blog serves as a platform for me to "learn out loud" and document my experiences as I explore various topics in technology and beyond.

I firmly believe in the power of open source and collaborative learning. By sharing my learning process, I hope to inspire others to embrace a growth mindset and join me in the pursuit of lifelong learning. I'm a strong advocate for the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, and I believe that we can all benefit from the collective wisdom of our communities.

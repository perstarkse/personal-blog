# Learning out loud

[A blog about growth and discovery - Per Stark]{.subtitle}

Welcome to my blog, a space where I share my journey of continuous learning and personal growth. As a psychologist and software developer, I've always been fascinated by the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge. This blog serves as a platform for me to "learn out loud" and document my experiences as I explore various topics in technology and beyond.

I firmly believe in the power of open source and collaborative learning. By sharing my learning process, I hope to inspire others to embrace a growth mindset and join me in the pursuit of lifelong learning. I'm a strong advocate for the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, and I believe that we can all benefit from the collective wisdom of our communities.

In this blog, you'll find me diving into a wide range of subjects that pique my curiosity. From the intricacies of NixOS and the art of writing academic articles using markdown, to the fascinating world of Ethereum development and the psychology behind user-centered design, I'm always eager to explore new ideas and perspectives.
